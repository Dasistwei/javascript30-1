    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // const newPlayers = players
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // newPlayers.push("Sue")
    // now here is the problem!
    // console.log(newPlayers, players)

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    const newPlayers01 = players.slice(0)
    newPlayers01.push("Sue")
    // console.log(players, newPlayers, 'dsf')
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const newPlayers02 = [].concat(players)
    newPlayers02.push("Sue")
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const newPlayers03= [...players]
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const newPlayers04= Array.from(players)
    newPlayers04.pop()
    // console.log(newPlayers04, players)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
      const newPerson = person
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      newPerson.age=100
      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const newPerson02 = Object.assign({}, person)
      newPerson02.age = 90
      // console.log(person, newPerson02)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const deepPerson = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80,
      socialMedias: {
        ig: '@wes',
        twitter: '@wes'
      }
    };
    // const newDeepPerson =  deepPerson
    // newDeepPerson.socialMedias.ig ="@pp"
    const newDeepPerson02 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(deepPerson))
    newDeepPerson02.socialMedias.ig = '@UU'
    // console.log()
    console.log(deepPerson.socialMedias.ig, newDeepPerson02.socialMedias.ig)
